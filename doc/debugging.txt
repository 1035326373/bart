Running a command in a debugger 
-------------------------------

This involves several (easy) steps:

1. Recompile BART with debugging information. Create
a Makefile.local in the BART directory with

CFLAGS += -ggdb -O2 -ffast-math


Then recompile with:

make allclean
make bart


2. Install the GNU debugger (gdb)

3. Run  from the command line with the input arguments
exported to BART format by writecfl.m:

gdb --args bart pics -g -S -d5 ....

4. Then type 'run' to start the process. After it fails,
type 'bt' to get a backtrace.
