Running a command in a debugger 
-------------------------------

This involves several (easy) steps:

1. Recompile BART with debugging information. Create
a Makefile.local in the BART directory with the
following line added:

DEBUG=1


Then recompile with:

make allclean
make bart


2. Install the GNU debugger (gdb)


3. Run the failing BART command:

gdb --args bart <command> [<options> ...] <arg1> ...


4. Then type 'run' to start the process. After it fails,
type 'bt' to get a backtrace.
