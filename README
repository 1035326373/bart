Prerequesites:

GCC compiler, the FFTW, GSL (or ACML) libraries and optionally 
a CUDA Implementation (see recon/Makefile to turn these
options on or off)

The software can be used in combination with Matlab or octave.



Linux:

The software tools in recon should run on any recent Linux distribution.

To install the required libraries on Debian and Ubuntu run:

sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev

(optional)
sudo apt-get install octave

(optional)
install the ISMRM Raw Data format library (http://ismrmrd.sourceforge.net/).



Mac OS X: 

Xcode is required and it is recommended to install a newer version 
of gcc (4.7 seems to work) from MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).


sudo port install fftw-3-single
sudo port install gsl
sudo port install gcc47
sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc47

(optional)
sudo apt-get install octave

(optional)
install the ISMRM Raw Data format library (http://ismrmrd.sourceforge.net/).

Getting started:



# Build the reconstruction tools

make

# Optionally build ISMRM raw data import tool
make ismrmrd


# Set the TOOLBOX_PATH and to the base directoy 
# and add it to the PATH variable.

. vars.sh



% Examples

% Download and unpack the examples which demonstrate
% interoperability with Matlab.

% In Matlab run:
% (you need to start Matlab with TOOLBOX_PATH set, e.g. from a
% terminal after typing '. vars.sh' to setup the paths)

examples


% Use Matlab to read and visualize/process files.

% Setup the path in Matlab:

addpath(strcat(getenv('TOOLBOX_PATH'), '/matlab'));

% Read data file xyz (see below):

A = readcfl('xyz');	% use name 'xyz' without file extension







Data format:

The input and output datasets are each stored in a pair of files: one
header (*.hdr) and one raw data (*.cfl). The header is a simple text
readable file that describes the dimensions of the data. The raw data
file is a binary file containing a single contiguous block of array
data of dimensions described in the header stored in column-major order
(first index is sequential). The raw data file is complex float 
(32 bit real + 32 bit imaginary, IEEE 747 binary32 little-endian).

Convenience methods to read and write our data files using Matlab may
be found in recon/matlab (readcfl.m and writecfl.m).




Command-line tools:

All tools operate on the simple file format given above. Indices and
dimensions run from 0 to N-1. Sometimes a set of dimensions is given
as a bitmask where the lowest bit corresponds to the 0st dimension.


For example, a Fourier transform of first three dimemensions can
be performed with the following command:


$ fft -i 7 kspace volume


More information about each command can be found in 'doc/commands.txt'.
